/*
 Problem Statement:
    Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai),
    n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
    Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
    Notice that you may not slant the container.
    
    Example:
        Input  : [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
        Output : 49
        Explanation : The maximum area of water is contained between walls with i=2 (height=8) and i=9 (height=7)
                      So, volume = min(8,7) * (9-2) = 7 * 7 = 49

        If left wall has less height than right wall, then
            We move to right to find walls higher than a[i] to increase the volume
            Note : As we increase x_coordinate, volume will decrease (as base length decreases)
                   and thus we check for higher walls to compensate for that and also find higher possible areas/volumes.
        
        If left wall has more or equal height than right wall, then
            We move to left to find higher walls than a[j] to increase the area/volume for the same reason as mentioned above.
        
        We continue this till we get left and right walls as adjacent to each other.
