# 39. Combination Sum

Given a **set** of candidate numbers (`candidates`) (**without duplicates**) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sums to `target`.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

**Note**:

- All numbers (including `target`) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Example 1:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```
